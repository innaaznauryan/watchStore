# watchStore

Welcome to a Watch Store project! 

This is a showcase of a fully responsive user interface for a watch store, implemented using SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) for styling.

### How to run the project

* Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/innaaznauryan/watchStore`

* You can launch the project in your preferred web browser by using `Live Server`

* Now you can test the responsiveness by resizing your browser window or accessing it from different devices.

Enjoy! And have a nice day!
